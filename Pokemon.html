                            <h2>Abstract</h2>
							<p>We constructed a test-session which revolves around the future of voice-control
                                interaction in games. It was conducted on the role-playing game (RPG) Pok√©mon FireRed
                                and the game was selected solely on its genre of turn-based gameplay which allows for an
                                easier interaction using voice commands. The test was conducted twice on a computer
                                where four participants were allowed to both play the game using a keyboard and using
                                voice commands separately. The program for the voice commands were created by us
                                using Dialogflow, a natural language understanding platform. The participants filled in a
                                questionnaire during the session and answered questions in an interview afterwards. It
                                was concluded that most participants preferred using voice commands over keyboard,
                                even though some internal issues with the program were discovered during the session.
                                Only one participant preferred using keyboard over voice, but he stated it was mainly due
                                to his personal previous experience of playing games on keyboard.</p>
